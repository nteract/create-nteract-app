## Batteries included :battery:

An app bootstrapped with `create-nteract-app` comes with:

- [@nteract](https://github.com/nteract) components for interactive computing apps/pages
- automatic webpack and babel configuration through [next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- live hot reloading
- [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/)
- every .js or .md file in `./pages` becomes a route that gets automatically processed and rendered!

This means you can write your app in `js`, `markdown` or even both! :smile:

Your new nteract app will have the following strucure,

```bash
.
├── __tests__
│   └── index-spec.js
├── components
│   ├── code-state.js
│   └── presentation-cell.js
├── next.config.js
├── package.json
├── pages
│   ├── _document.js
│   └── index.js
├── scripts
│   └── test-setup.js
└── yarn.lock
```

## Commands :robot:

1. `yarn dev`

   This will start the next.js server on port `3000` by default. Note, to change the port, run `yarn dev -p YOUR_PORT`

2. `yarn test`

   This will kick off the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) test suite. By default, we have included a snapshot test.

3. `yarn build`

   This will produce an optimize set of code for production.

4. `yarn start`

   This will run your optimized app on port 3000.

5. `yarn export`

   This will export your code as a static HTML app.
